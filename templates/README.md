![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2856%29.png)

Here you can view and edit all your templates. You can create folders where templates can be dragged to in order to help sorting them. To make a new template, you can click on the green 'new' button. A template will then be made in the map that's open.

The template page can be divide in 3 parts

On the left are all the different kinds of fields that can be added to a step. Below that are standard fields as created by the user. \(See \#FillTheDoc UI for info on standard fields\)

In the middle part, you can see the Form with all created steps and fields. Steps can be minimized, edited and deleted. You can add a field by dragging it to one of the created steps. \(See \#Form\)

In the right part of the screen, you can see the content. Here you can add all the text and design your template to your liking. Make sure you click on save from time to time. You can view your document by clicking on view, this will show the document in its final form and allows you to fill in your fields. You can go back to editing by clicking on edit again. \(To see how to add your dynamic fields in the text, check out \#Content\)

When you're done editting your template and are ready to use it, click on the green 'publish' button.

## Using an existing document as template

In order to digitize an existing document, it must first be converted to plain text, which is copied to an empty template. The layout needs to be reapplied manually in fillthedoc.

After the layout, the ‘programming’ of the fields and options begins. This is where the document is made dynamic so that it is usable in the software.
